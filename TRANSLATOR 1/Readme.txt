# üó£Ô∏è English to Chhattisgarhi Speech Translator

A smart, dual-mode voice and text translator built in Python. This application provides real-time, speech-to-speech translation when online and intelligently falls back to a text-to-speech mode using a local dictionary when offline.

## ## Key Features ‚ú®

* **üåê Dual-Mode Operation**: Automatically detects internet connectivity and switches between two modes:
    * **Online Mode**: Full-featured, real-time, speech-to-speech translation.
    * **Offline Mode**: Text-to-speech translation using locally saved phrases.
* **üß† AI-Powered Translation**: Leverages the OpenAI API (`gpt-4o-mini`) for accurate and context-aware translations in online mode.
* **üíæ Smart Caching**: Every new translation fetched online is saved to a local `translations.json` file, expanding the translator's offline capabilities over time.
* **üîä High-Quality Voice Synthesis**:
    * Uses Google Text-to-Speech (`gTTS`) for natural-sounding voices online.
    * Employs a cutting-edge, offline AI model from Hugging Face (`transformers`) for high-quality speech synthesis without an internet connection.
* **üí™ Robust and Reliable**: Built with robust audio playback libraries (`sounddevice`, `pydub`) to avoid common errors and ensure smooth operation, especially on Windows.

## ## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The application starts by checking for an internet connection to determine the operating mode.

### ### Online Mode (Internet Detected)

1.  **Listen**: The microphone listens for English speech using the `speech_recognition` library.
2.  **Transcribe**: The speech is converted to text using Google's Web Speech API.
3.  **Translate**: The English text is sent to the OpenAI API, which returns the translation in Chhattisgarhi.
4.  **Cache**: The new translation pair is saved to `translations.json`.
5.  **Speak**: The Chhattisgarhi text is converted to high-quality audio using `gTTS` and played back.

### ### Offline Mode (No Internet)

1.  **Input**: The user types English text into the console.
2.  **Lookup**: The program searches for the text in the `translations.json` file.
3.  **Translate**: If found, it retrieves the corresponding Chhattisgarhi text.
4.  **Speak**: The Chhattisgarhi text is synthesized into audio locally using the Hugging Face `transformers` AI model and played back through the speakers.
